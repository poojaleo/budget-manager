# Track Budget Service Design

## 1. Problem Statement

Track Budget is a service to track all your expenses at one place. The purpose of the website is to create a simple
efficient product to manage your expenses.

Userâ€™s can add, update, delete an expense and also create categories to manage the expenses.
This allows users to gain a better understanding of where their money is going. Track Budget also alerts users
when the user surpasses 75% budget threshold.

U2. As an TrackBudget customer, I want the session to be secured as the information is highly sensitive.

expense date and merchant/vendor used

U6. As an TrackBudget customer, I want to create multiple categories and
set monthly budget for each category.

U8. As an TrackBudget customer, I can delete a category if not in use.

U7. As an TrackBudget customer, I want to be notified when I exceed my budget.

## 4. Architecture

![Architecture](/src/main/resources/classdiagrams/TrackBudgetArchitecture.png)
*Figure 1: Diagram showing the architecture of Track Budget Application. A user using the Front End React Website makes an API call which connects 
to the AWS load balancer. This forwards the requests to ECS, which connects to a persistent data store for fulfilling the 
request and sends the response back to the client.*
